# math_of_machine_learning
This is the code for "Mathematcs of Machine Learning" by Siraj Raval on Youtube 


## Coding Challenge - Due date, March 23, 2018 

Build your own regression model to make a predict. Bonus points for 1) a cool dataset or idea 2) for building it using pure numpy 3) good documentation Post github links in the comment section. Good luck!




## Overview 

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/8onB7rPG4Pk) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval about the math of ML. This code uses linear regression to predict housing prices in NYC. 

## Instructions

Run the code via the 'jupyter notebook' command in the root directory. install jupyter [here](http://jupyter.org/)

## Credits

Credits for this code go to [shreyas](https://github.com/Shreyas3108/house-price-prediction/blob/master/housesales.ipynb) i've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
